  Hi, my name's Evan and I'm a recent college graduate looking for a job in the tech industry. I have worked a lot with C++ and Java, but I am also familiar with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am working on making a few different small games like snake or tetris in a few languages, such as python, JavaScript (which I plan to embed here), Java, and C#.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>Java</mark> and <mark>Playing Guitar Mediocrely</mark>

          I started working on this project to learn more about JavaScript and how to use it to make a game. I plan to add more features to this game as I learn more about JavaScript and how to use it. I also happen to love video games so made something useless instead of something like, well, I don't know.

          Ever experienced a 50-foot dragon fly overhead? I haven't either, but I have seen a *simulated* 50-foot dragon fly over my head and shoot a crossbow at it.

          I worked at Diablo Escapes as an Intern where I configured a network of multiple VR machines and PCs to facilitate a seamless wireless VR escape room experience, ensuring that all required programs were set to launch automatically upon startup. Additionally, I diagnosed and resolved issues with malfunctioning PC and VR hardware components, restoring full functionality. Throught, I comprehensively documentated the step-by-step setup and troubleshooting procedures, designed to assist future team members with limited familiarity of PC and VR systems.
          
          I was also in charge of making sure neither the dragon nor the interns ate each other.

          Established in 1809, Miami University "bears the name of the Myaamia people", and retains a relationship with the Miami Tribe of Okhlahoma. Miami is a top 50 public university according to U.S. News and World Report, and the number two ranked university for undergraduate engineering.

          During my time at Miami I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as an active member of the *League of Geeks*, which had many sub clubs I participated in such as the *Strategy Gaming Club* or the *Esports Club*.
